Abstract:
Work stress and thermal discomfort are some of the hurdles that office workers face every day.
Office workers experience a periodic work stress because work is long and mentally challenging.
At the same time, current thermal comfort provision technologies are inefficient and consume a
large amount of energy. In our previous works, we proposed an efficient thermal comfort provision
system that is based on a person's heart rate variability (HRV). However, because work stress can
also affect the person's HRV, this paper investigates the possibility to distinguish HRV changes
that are due to thermal discomfort from changes that emanate from work stress. We conducted
experiments on subjects taking Advanced Trail Making Test (ATMT) and observed that stress
alters HRV and that it is possible to distinguish stressed and non-stressed subjects with a 100%
accuracy. We validated our method on the multimodal SWELL knowledge work (SWELL-KW)
stress dataset and achieved similar results (99.25% accuracy and 99.75% average recall). Further
analysis suggests that, although both thermal comfort and work stress affect HRV, their effect
is perhaps non-overlapping, and that the two can be distinguished with a near-perfect accuracy.
These results indicate that it could be possible to design an automatic and unobtrusive system
that delivers thermal comfort and predicts work stress based on people's HRV
