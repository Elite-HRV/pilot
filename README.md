Welcome to Elite HRV's data science challenge!

Heart rate variability has been studied as an indicator for individuals' health and has been shown to correlate with perceived stress. For this data science challenge, we will be digging into the SWELL Knowledge Work dataset. Published in 2014, this dataset measures stress of individuals doing various knowledge work related tasks. Details of the dataset and some previous studies are outlined in the [papers](data/papers) included in this repository. You can find the dataset in [data](data). Training, validation, and test splits are provided, but feel free to combine the splits in any way that you find interesting. 


## Challenge Aims

We would like to keep this challenge fairly open ended, as members of our R&D team work with 
a good deal of freedom. What we ask is that you work with the data and papers provided in this repository, using the tools of data science and machine learning to provide some insight into this dataset. You will find that the papers include frame a classification problem for this data, but you are not required to tackle that particular problem. We'd be happy to see solutions for the classification problem, but unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches are welcome too. You could also approach this data with regression in mind. Choose whatever interests you most, and keep in mind that we will want to talk through your approach in a follow on interview! 

Please structure your work in whatever way you see fit. This optionally includes Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, or a Python package (see below for bits on packaging). Clarity, reproducibility, and reusability are highly valued, even over novelty and (sometimes) performance!


Lastly, thank you for participating in our data science challenge. We are excited to talk through your ideas!


## The `pilot` package

To get things started, we have created a scaffold for a Python package, `pilot`, in case you choose to develop your code as a pip installable Python project. Note that some of the fields in [`setup.py`](setup.py) are intentionally left blank for you to fill in your name and associated details!

#### Setup

```
python setup.py install
```
