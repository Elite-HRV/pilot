Welcome to Elite HRV's data science challenge!

Heart rate variability has been studied as an indicator for individuals' health and has been shown to correlate with perceived stress. For this data science challenge, we will be digging into the SWELL Knowledge Work dataset. Published in 2014, this dataset measures stress of individuals doing various knowledge work related tasks. Details of the dataset and some previous studies are outlined in the [papers](data/papers) included in this repository. You can find the dataset in [data](data). Training, validation, and test splits are provided, but feel free to combine the splits in any way that you find interesting. 

## The `pilot` package

To get things started, we have created a scaffold for a Python package, `pilot`, in case you choose to develop your code as a pip installable Python project. Note that some of the fields in [`setup.py`](setup.py) are intentionally left blank for you to fill in your name and associated details!

#### Setup

```
python setup.py install
```
